I plan to publish the next canary statement within 14 days of this message.

This file MUST be signed and verified with a detached OpenPGP signature. Do not trust the contents of this file blindly - always verify digital signatures. Take special note if this message ceases to exist or gets outdated.

## Disclaimers and notes

This canary scheme is not infallible. Signing the declaration makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, but this does not prevent the use of coercion, blackmail, compromise of the signer's laptop or other measures to produce false declarations.

The RSS feeds quoted below (see `Proof of freshness`) confirm this canary could not have been created earlier than the issue date. This demonstrates a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is provided without any guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding upon any parties in any form. The signer can not be held legally responsible for any statements made here.
